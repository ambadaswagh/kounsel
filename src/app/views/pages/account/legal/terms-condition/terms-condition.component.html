                    </li>
                    <li><strong>ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES.</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>User Account.</i>&nbsp;The User may register to the Platform with an account in order to make use of certain functions and/or the Service (the&nbsp;<strong>“User
                                    Account”</strong>). By registering for a User Account on the Platform, or by clicking to accept the Agreement when prompted on the Platform, the User is deemed to
                                have
                                executed
                                this Agreement and any other document listed on such prompt electronically, effective on the date the User registers its User Account or clicks to accept the Agreement.
                                The
                                User’s
                                Account registration constitutes an acknowledgement that the User is able to electronically receive, download, and print this Agreement, the other Agreement, and any
                                amendments.
                                The Company reserves the right to terminate or suspend any User’s User Account and/or access to the Platform and the Service if the Company determines (in its sole
                                discretion) that
                                any such User has violated this Agreement.</li>
                            <li><i>Profile.</i>&nbsp;Upon registering for a User Account, the User may complete a User profile (a&nbsp;<strong>“Profile”</strong>), which the User consents to be shown
                                to
                                other
                                Users and, unless the User change the User’s privacy settings, the public. If the User is a Counselor (i.e., a User that is providing the service), the User represents
                                and
                                warrants
                                that the User uses its Profile to market its business to others for the purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with Hosts (i.e., a User that is
                                requesting
                                and paying for the service). The User agrees to provide true, accurate, and complete information on its Profile and all registration and other forms the User’s access
                                on
                                the
                                Platform or provide to the Company and to update the User’s information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness. The User agrees not to provide and to
                                correct any
                                information about the User’s location, its business, its skills, or the services its business provides that is or becomes false or misleading. The User agrees not to
                                register for
                                more than one Counselor Profile and one Host Account without express written permission from the Company. The User agrees not to ask or allow another person to create a

                                Account on its behalf, for its use, or for its benefit.</li>
                            <li><i>Identity Verification.</i>&nbsp;When the User registers for an Account and from time to time thereafter, the User’s Account will be subject to verification,
                                including,
                                but not
                                limited to, validation against third-party databases or the verification of one or more official government or legal documents that confirm the User’s identity and the
                                User’s
                                ability to represent its business on the Platform, if it is a separate legal entity. The User authorizes the Company, directly or through third parties, to make any
                                inquiries
                                necessary to validate its identity and confirm its ownership of its email address or financial accounts, subject to applicable law. When requested, the User must
                                provide
                                the
                                Company with information about the User and the User’s business.</li>
                            <li><i>User Names and Passwords.</i>&nbsp;The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password that the User designates during the
                                registration
                                process, and the User is fully responsible for all activities that occur under the User Account. The User agrees to: (i) immediately notify the Company of any
                                unauthorized
                                use of
                                the User Account or any other breach of security, and (ii) ensure that the User exits from the User Account at the end of each session. The Company will not be liable
                                for
                                any loss
                                or damage arising from the User’s failure to comply with this provision. The User should use particular caution when accessing the User Account from a public or shared
                                computer to
                                ensure that others are not able to view or record the User Account’s username and password and/or other personal information.</li>
                            <li><i>Marketplace Feedback.</i>&nbsp;The User acknowledges and agrees that feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Platform and the User
                                specifically
                                request that the Company post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Platform. The User acknowledges and
                                agrees that
                                feedback results for the User, including its Job Success Score (<strong>“JSS”</strong>), if any, will consist of comments, ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and
                                other
                                feedback left by other Users. The User further acknowledges and agrees that the Company will make feedback results available to other marketplace Users, including
                                composite
                                or
                                compiled feedback. The Company provides this feedback system as a means through which Users can share their opinions publicly and the Company does not monitor or censor
                                these
                                opinions. The User acknowledges and agrees that posted composite or compiled feedback and any JSS relate only to the business advertised in the User Profile and not to
                                any
                                individual person. The User agrees not to use the JSS to make any employment, credit, credit valuation, underwriting, or other similar decision about any other User.
                                The
                                Company
                                does not investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability but may do so if a User requests that the Company do so. The User may be held legally
                                responsible for
                                damages suffered by other Users or third parties as a result of the User’s remarks if such remarks are legally actionable or defamatory. The Company is not legally
                                responsible for
                                any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Platform by any Users or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable.
                                In
                                order to

                                the appropriate authorities (including penalties and interest). In the event of an audit of Company, Counselor agrees to promptly cooperate with Company and provide

                                of

                            <li><i>Payment Method.</i>&nbsp;In order to use certain Platform Services, Host must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method. Host hereby
                                authorizes
                                the
                                Company to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Host, to store credit card and banking or other financial details as Host’s method of payment
                                for
                                Services, and to charge Host’s credit card (or any other Payment Method). Credit cards and PayPal accounts and, if applicable, bank accounts in most countries will be
                                charged by
                                the Company. By providing Payment Method information through the Platform, Host represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) Host is legally authorized to provide such
                                information; (b) Host is legally authorized to perform payments using the Payment Method(s); and (c) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to
                                Host’s use
                                of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law. When Host authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Platform, Host represents, warrants, and covenants that there
                                are
                                sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement or the other
                                agreements
                                cannot be collected from Host’s Payment Method(s), Host is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.</li>
                            <li><i>US Dollars and Foreign Currency Conversion.&nbsp;</i>The Platform and the Platform Services operate in U.S. Dollars. If Host’s Payment Method is denominated in a
                                currency other
                                than U.S. Dollars and requires currency conversion to make payments in U.S. Dollars, the Platform may display foreign currency conversion rates that the Company
                                currently
                                makes
                                available to convert supported foreign currencies to U.S. Dollars. These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Please note that
                                the
                                wholesale currency conversion rates at which the Company obtains foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the
                                Platform.
                                Host, at its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to U.S. Dollars
                                at
                                the
                                foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Platform. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Platform. If foreign currency conversion is
                                required
                                to make
                                a payment in U.S. Dollars and the Company does not support the foreign currency or Host does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency
                                conversion
                                rate
                                displayed on the Platform, the Company will charge Host’s Payment Method in U.S. Dollars and Host’s Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign
                                currency
                                conversion rate selected by Host’s Payment Method provider. Host’s Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method used to fund a
                                cross-border
                                payment
                                even when no currency conversion is involved. Host’s authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Platform is at Host’s sole
                                risk.
                                The
                                Company are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars. The
                                Company
                                are not
                                responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments via wire transfer, check or automated clearinghouse to and from the Escrow Account.

                            <li><i>Limited Payment Protection.</i>&nbsp;The Company only provides Payment Protection to Counselors if the following criteria are met: (a) Host has a verified Payment
                                Method; (b)
                                the time represented is captured online using the Company’s software; (c) the Counselor Services performed and recorded in the Transaction Log pertain directly to the
                                Service
                                Contract; and (d) each Transaction Log is annotated with descriptions of the Counselor Services performed, demonstrating Service Contract compliance. The company
                                determines
                                whether
                                the foregoing criteria have been met in the Company’s sole discretion. Without limiting the foregoing, Payment Protection does not apply to: (w) Counselors, Counselor
                                Services, or
                                Service Contracts violating this Agreement or the other agreements; (x) Counselors that are aware of or complicit in another User’s violation of this Agreement or the

                    <li><strong>PRIVILEGE POINTS.&nbsp;</strong>Upon successful completion of a counseling service, Counselor and Host will be able to review each other using ratings and comments. The
                        Company
                        maintains separate Host and Counselor ratings. Such ratings are referred to as&nbsp;<strong>“Privilege Points.”</strong>&nbsp;The Users agree and acknowledge that they will
                        have
                        separate
                        ratings related to their performance as both Host and Counselor separate from one another should they register as both on the Platform. The Company has the right to ban any
                        User or
                        remove
                        access from its Platform based on such ratings. The Company may restrict access to different parts of the Platform based on such ratings. E.g., Counselors/Hosts will not be
                        able to
                        accept/start a direct counselling session if Privilege Point ratings fall below 2.5.</li>

                        the
                        appointment, with 24 hours advance notice. All Service Fees as described herein shall apply to such appointment. So long as the appointment is cancelled within the stated

                            <li><i>Scope.</i>&nbsp;Arbitration as provided in this Arbitration Provision is governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.). This
                                Arbitration
                                Provision applies to any Claim the parties may have and survives after the User’s relationship with the Company ends. This Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to
                                the
                                resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. If for any reason JAMS will not administer the
                                arbitration,
                                either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral
                                arbitrator.</li>
                            <li><i>Location.</i>&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided herein, arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive
                                Arbitration
                                Rules and Procedures under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Claims by Users that allege
                                employment
                                or
                                worker classification claims will be conducted within twenty five (25) miles of where the User is located in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules and
                                Procedures
                                then in effect. The JAMS arbitration rules may be found at www.jamsadr.com or by searching online for&nbsp;<strong>“JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
                                    Procedures”</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>“JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules.”</strong>&nbsp;The parties agree that any party will have the right to appear at the

                                by telephone and/or video rather than in person. The User and the Company will follow the applicable JAMS rules with respect to arbitration fees. In any arbitration
                                under
                                the JAMS
                                Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures, the User will pay JAMS arbitration fees only to the extent those fees are no greater than the filing or initial appearance
                                fees
                                applicable to court actions in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. The arbitrator must follow applicable law and may award only those remedies
                                that
                                would have
                                applied had the matter been heard in court. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having jurisdiction.</li>
                            <li><i>Limitation.</i>&nbsp;This Arbitration Provision does not apply to litigation between the Company and the User to which the User is a party that is or was already
                                pending
                                in a
                                state or federal court before the expiration of the User’s opt-out period. This Arbitration Provision also does not apply to claims for workers compensation, state
                                disability
                                insurance or unemployment insurance benefits. Either the User or the Company may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for provisional injunctive relief in
                                connection
                                with an
                                arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such relief; the arbitrator will
                                render the
                                final judgment in the matter</li>
                            <li><i>Administrative Claims.</i>&nbsp;Regardless of any other terms of this Arbitration Provision, a claim may be brought by or to, and remedies awarded by, an
                                administrative
                                agency
                                if applicable law permits the agency to adjudicate, investigate or prosecute the claim notwithstanding the existence of this agreement to arbitrate. Such administrative
                                claims
                                include without limitation claims or charges brought before the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the National Labor
                                Relations
                                Board.
                                Nothing in this Arbitration Provision will be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the
                                party’s
                                obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration, if any.</li>

                                Provision
                                covers,
                                and the arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this
                                Arbitration
                                Provision, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters
                                shall
                                be
                                decided by an arbitrator and not by a court. The parties expressly agree that the arbitrator and not a court will decide any question of whether the parties agreed to
                                arbitrate,
                                including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Agreement is void or voidable.</li>
                            <li><i>Severability.</i>&nbsp;In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be
                                enforceable.
                                If any
                                portion of the Class Action Waiver below is deemed to be unenforceable, the User and Company agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest
                                extent
                                permitted

                            <li><i>Class Action Waiver.</i>&nbsp;<strong>This arbitration provision affects the User’s ability to participate in class, collective or representative actions. Both the

                                    Company agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or representative basis on behalf of others. There
                                    will

                                    such
                                    class, collective, representative or private attorney general proceeding (“Class Action Waiver”). The Class Action Waiver does not prevent the User from bringing a
                                    Claim in
                                    arbitration as a private attorney general solely on the User’s own behalf and not on behalf of others. Notwithstanding any other portion of this Arbitration
                                    Provision

                                    determines that the waiver of such class, collective, or representative Claim is unenforceable. The User and the Company agree that the User will not be retaliated

                <p><i>Effective Date: April 2, 2018.</i></p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy was updated as of April 2, 2018 and governs the policies followed by Mirach LLC and its website&nbsp;<a href="https://kounsel.io/">www.kounsel.io</a>&nbsp;and
                    the
                    affiliated mobile application (collectively, the&nbsp;<strong>“Platform”</strong>).</p>
                <p><strong>Two Types of Information Collected</strong></p>
                <p>We will refer, in this document, to two types of information: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;<strong>“Personally Identifiable
                        Information”</strong>&nbsp;(also abbreviated to&nbsp;<strong>“PII”</strong>) is information that can be traced to your identity (e.g., name, address, phone number,
                    etc.).&nbsp;<strong>“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”</strong>&nbsp;(also abbreviated to&nbsp;<strong>“NPI”</strong>) is all other such information that cannot be traced to
                    your
                    identity.</p>
                <p><strong>Privacy Policy Purpose</strong></p>
                <p>We strongly believe in protecting the privacy rights of our users. Thus, it is important that we clearly describe (i) what PII we collect; (ii) with whom/how we share your PII; and
                    (iii) how
                    you can limit our sharing of your PII. In short, we are committed to your privacy.</p>
                <p><strong>Third Party Websites</strong></p>
                <p>There may be links to other websites on our Platform. You understand that we cannot control the privacy policies of the operators of such third-party websites and this privacy
                    policy will not
                    cover the use of such third-party websites. Thus, it is important that you understand that you must check the privacy policies of such third-party websites and independently decide
                    if you
                    should browse such sites and/or use the services offered therein.</p>
                <p><strong>Information That We Collect and How We Use It</strong></p>
                <p><i>Personally Identifiable Information, Generally:</i>&nbsp;Through our Platform, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, payment account, and any image you upload to
                    the
                    account.</p>
                <p><i>Profile:</i>&nbsp;You may also create a profile through which you may enter certain information that may be viewable to other Kounsel users, including: name, profession, city,
                    state, and
                    country. You may also provide your identifying handle for certain social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Medium, etc.).</p>
                <p><i>Forum:</i>&nbsp;You may also choose to share personal information in our forum. While we may not actively collect personally identifiable information through user posts, the
                    information will
                    be viewable to other forum users.</p>
                <p><i>Identity Verification:</i>&nbsp;We may also collect information necessary to (among other reasons) (i) comply with applicable tax laws such as your tax identification number;
                    (ii) protect
                    against spam; and (iii) verify your age. We may request additional information at our discretion to verify any such information.</p>
                <p><i>Third Parties:</i>&nbsp;We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, should you sign in with a third-party service, we may receive certain
                    information through
                    that service. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Platform, we will treat the combined information as described in this
                    Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p><i>Testimonials:</i>&nbsp;We may, with your consent, post a testimonial with your name attached to it. Testimonials will be public to general internet users.</p>
                <p><i>Feedback:</i>&nbsp;You may choose to post personal information in any feedback left for any other user on the Platform. This feedback may be viewable to other Kounsel users or to
                    any person
                    using the Platform, whether registered as a user or not.</p>
                <p><i>Social Networks:</i>&nbsp;You may register to join the Platform directly via the Service or by logging into your account with a third party social network (e.g., Facebook) via
                    our Platform.
                    If you choose to register via an social network, or to later link your account with the Platform to your account with an social network, we will use the Personally Identifiable
                    Information you
                    have provided to the social network (such as your name, email address, gender and other information you make publicly available via the social network) to create your account. Note
                    that the
                    information we collect from and through an social network may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the social network and the permissions you grant to us in connection
                    with linking
                    your account with the Service to your account with a social network. Other than what we may share with the social network as described below, the Personally Identifiable
                    Information a social
                    network has about you is obtained by the social network independent of our Platform, and Kounsel is not responsible for it.</p>
                <p>The Kounsel service also may permit additional interactions between it and a third party website, service, or other content provider, such as enabling you to, e.g., share content to
                    a third
                    party social network. If you choose to share content, or to otherwise share information from or via our Platform with a third party site or service, that information may be
                    publicly displayed,
                    and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Platform (and we may have access to information about you from that third party). These features
                    may collect
                    your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Platform, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with third parties through a social
                    network or
                    similar features are governed by the respective privacy policies of those third parties.</p>
                <p>You represent that you are entitled to use your social network account for the purposes described herein without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the
                    social network,
                    and without obligating Kounsel to pay any fees or making Kounsel subject to any usage limitations imposed by such social network. Please note that your relationship with any social
                    network is
                    governed solely by your agreement(s) with such social network. If your social network account terminates, then functions enabled through the link between your Kounsel account and
                    your social
                    network account will terminate as well.</p>
                <p><i>Cookies:</i>&nbsp;When you visit the Platform, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our websites, to personalize your online experience, and
                    to record
                    information about your visit to the Platform. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on the Platform, such as the web
                    pages you
                    visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while visiting the Platform if you have enabled cookies. You may disable the use of cookies through
                    your browser.
                </p>
                <p><i>Web Beacons:</i>&nbsp;We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as&nbsp;<strong>“web
                        beacons”</strong>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<strong>“tracking tags”</strong>&nbsp;to help us keep track of what content on our Platform is effective and to serve relevant advertising to
                    you. Web
                    beacons are small graphics, embedded in web pages and/or emails, with a unique identifier. These items are used to track online activity including, without limitation, to count
                    visitors to our
                    Platform, to monitor how users navigate the Platform, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually
                    viewed.</p>
                <p><i>Embedded Scripts:</i>&nbsp;We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an&nbsp;<strong>“embedded
                        script.”</strong>&nbsp;An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platform, such as the links you click on.
                    The code is
                    temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you leave the Platform.</p>
                <p><i>Do Not Track Services:</i>&nbsp;Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a&nbsp;<strong>“do not track”</strong>&nbsp;signal to websites and online service you
                    visit.
                    Kounsel does not alter its practices when it receives a&nbsp;<strong>“do not track”</strong>&nbsp;signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about&nbsp;<strong>“do not
                        track,”</strong>&nbsp;you may visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>
                <p><i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</i>&nbsp;The Platform may automatically collect NPI from your web browser or mobile device (e.g., how you arrived at/left our Platform,
                    your IP
                    address, web provider, browser type, mobile device/computer operating system). We use all of this information to analyze trends among our users to help improve our Platform and
                    services
                    offered.</p>
                <p><i>Disclosures:</i>&nbsp;Additionally, we may disclose your information: (i) in response to a subpoena, court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement agencies; (ii)
                    to defend
                    against legal claims; (iii) when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activity, fraud or
                    wrongdoing; (iv)
                    to protect the rights, property, and safety of our company, users, employees or others; (v) to enforce any agreement to which we are a party; (vi) in the event of a substantial
                    corporate
                    transaction, such as the sale of our business, merger, or consolidation; or (vii) as otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p><strong><i>The previous paragraphs notwithstanding, we will not disclose your PII or NPI, and all of the information collected is used solely for analytical purposes connected to
                            the operation
                            of the Platform. The following provides more specific details:</i></strong></p>
                <p><i>Information about Counselors:</i>&nbsp;We share information regarding Counselors working on a Host project with Hosts. Note that if a Counselor is suspended from the Platform (or
                    such
                    Counselor makes his or her profile private on our Platform), we may share that information with Hosts for whom that Counselor has worked or interacted with on the Platform. If you
                    choose to
                    apply for work as a Counselor via the Platform, we will share information relevant to your application with the applicable Host(s), including, but not limited to, the information
                    contained in
                    your Counselor profile.</p>
                <p><i>Service Providers:</i>&nbsp;We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the services provided through the Platform, to perform Platform-related services
                    (e.g., without
                    limitation, maintenance services, database management, analytics and online advertising, payment processing, fraud detection and improvement of Kounsel’s features) or to assist us
                    in analyzing
                    how our Platform is used. These third parties may have access to your Personally Identifiable Information in order to perform these tasks on our behalf.</p>
                <p><i>Legal Purposes:</i>&nbsp;Kounsel will share information with government agencies as required by law, including without limitation, in connection with reporting earnings. We
                    cooperate with
                    government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials
                    or private
                    parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), at the request of
                    governmental
                    authorities or other third parties conducting an investigation, to protect the property and rights of Kounsel or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person,
                    or to prevent
                    or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, fraudulent, unethical or legally actionable activity. We may also use device identifiers to identify
                    Kounsel users,
                    and may do so in cooperation with third parties at our discretion.</p>
                <p><i>Promotions:</i>&nbsp;We may offer a variety of promotions (<strong>“Promotions”</strong>) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the
                    official
                    rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your
                    name, voice,
                    likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personally Identifiable Information may be
                    disclosed to
                    third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as
                    required by
                    law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winner’s list.</p>
                <p><strong>Third Party Analytics Providers</strong></p>
                <p>Kounsel works with network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Platform, including pages
                    viewed and
                    the actions taken when visiting the Platform; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile apps and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding
                    the use of
                    the Platform and the effectiveness of our advertisements. Our service providers may collect certain information about your visits to and activity on the Platform as well as other
                    websites or
                    services, they may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons), and may use that information to show you targeted
                    advertisements. Some of
                    these parties may collect Personally Identifiable Information when you visit the Platform or other online websites and services. We may also share certain NPI with these parties in
                    connection
                    with the services they provide to us.</p>
                <p><strong>Opting Out</strong></p>
                <p>You may update your choices regarding the types of communications you receive from us through your online account. You also may opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us by
                    following the
                    opt-out instructions provided in those emails. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of the Platform (for
                    example,
                    administrative and service announcements) via email and other means and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you opt-out from receiving marketing
                    communications. You may

                <p><strong>Closing Your Account</strong></p>
                <p>Upon request Kounsel will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information
                    you submit to
                    us, such as your contact information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by making updates to that information or by contacting Kounsel
                    through your
                    online account. If you request to access all personal information you’ve submitted, we will respond to your request to access within thirty (30) days. If you completely delete all
                    such
                    information, then your account may become deactivated. If your account is deactivated or you ask to close your account, you will no longer be able to use the Service. If you would
                    like us to
                    delete your account in our system, you can do so through the Platform. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request; however, certain information will actively
                    persist on
                    the Service even if you close your account, including your transaction history and communications with other users. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information may remain
                    in our
                    archives and information you update or delete, or information within a closed account, may persist internally or for our administrative purposes. It is not always possible to
                    completely remove
                    or delete information from our databases. In addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly through or on the Platform. Neither you nor Kounsel can delete
                    all copies of
                    information that has been previously shared with others on the Service</p>
                <p><strong>Children Accessing the Platform or Our Products</strong></p>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 18, as this is meant to be a general audience service and our products and website are not
                    intended for the
                    use of such children. Should it be revealed to us that we have inadvertently collected information from children under the age of 18, then we will take reasonable measures to
                    eliminate such
                    data from our servers.</p>
                <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                <p>Kounsel takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the information it collects and stores about its users. All access to the Platform is encrypted using
                    industry-standard
                    transport layer security technology (TLS). When you enter sensitive information (such as tax identification number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure
                    socket layer
                    technology (SSL). We also use HTTP strict transport security to add an additional layer of protection for our users. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
                    or method of
                    electronic storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal data, Kounsel cannot ensure and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit to
                    us.</p>
                <p><strong>International Transfers of Information</strong></p>
                <p>Kounsel is a United States company. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Kounsel transfers Personally Identifiable Information to
                    the United
                    States for processing. The United States may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer your
                    information to the
                    United States, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy. By visiting the Platform, or providing Kounsel with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously
                    consent to
                    this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States.</p>
                <p><strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong></p>
                <p>Our Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is
                    not an
                    endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We
                    do not
                    exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you.
                    We
                    encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
                <p><strong>Phishing</strong></p>
                <p>Phishing websites imitate legitimate websites in order to obtain personal or financial information. Identity theft and the practice currently known
                    as&nbsp;<strong>“phishing”</strong>&nbsp;are
                    of great concern to Kounsel. For more information about phishing, visit the website of the Federal Trade Commission at&nbsp;<a

                <p>Please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@mirach.co">legal@mirach.co</a>&nbsp;if you believe you have been a target of phishing through the Platform.</p>
                <p><strong>California Disclosure</strong></p>
                <p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who provide us with personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household
                    use are
                    entitled to request and obtain from us, one time per calendar year, information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct
                    marketing uses.
                    Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Kounsel does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-in or opt-out) regarding
                    sharing
                    Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this
                    Privacy
                    Policy, Kounsel provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to
                    opt-out at the
                    time Kounsel offers that choice, Kounsel does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.</p>
                <p>If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your
                    ability to

                <p>This Confidentiality Policy (the&nbsp;<strong>“Confidentiality Policy”</strong>), effective as of April 2, 2018 states the terms and conditions that govern the confidality
                    obligations by and
                    between Counselors and Hosts (collectively, the&nbsp;<strong>“Parties”</strong>) with regard to engagements on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kounsel.io/">www.kounsel.io</a>&nbsp;and its
                    affiliated
                    mobile application (collectively, the&nbsp;<strong>“Platform”</strong>), which is owned and operated by Mirach LLC (the&nbsp;<strong>“Company”</strong>).</p>
                <p>The Company provides the Platform to the Parties to engage to perform certain services (each, an&nbsp;<strong>“Engagement”</strong>) on the condition that such parties will abide by
                    the
                    Confidentiality Policy outlined herein. Thus, the obligations herein are&nbsp;<strong>material terms</strong>&nbsp;of any such Engagement unless expressly waived by the Parties to
                    such
                    Engagement.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the Parties should be advised that depending on the nature of the Engagement, the Parties may be bound to professional obligations such as doctor-patient or
                    attorney-client
                    relationships. It is the Company’s intent that it provide the Platform such that these relationships may be fostered. Thus, any Counselor performing services via the Platform
                    should be aware
                    of his or her professional obligations and the fact that an Engagement may create such a relationship.</p>
                <p>Now, therefore, the Parties agree and acknowledge that they shall be bound by the following terms in any such Engagement, whereby the Party receiving the Confidential Information
                    shall be
                    the&nbsp;<strong>“Recipient”</strong>&nbsp;and the party providing the Confidential Information shall be the&nbsp;<strong>“Disclosing Party:”</strong></p>

                <p>DIGITAL SIGNATURE.&nbsp;By clicking to accept a counseling session, Host and Counselor are deemed to have executed this Agreement electronically, effective on the date Counselor
                    clicks to
                    accept the Engagement, pursuant to California Civil Code section 1633.8 and the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (the E-Sign Act) (15 U.S.C. Sec.
                    7001, et
                    seq.). Doing so constitutes an acknowledgement that the User is able to electronically receive, download, and print this Agreement and the Escrow Instructions it contains.<br>
                    MAKING OR RECEIVING HOURLY PAYMENT.<br>
                    Transaction Logs.&nbsp;Reports of hours billed (“Transaction Logs”) are generated each time a Host starts a counseling session. Counselor irrevocably authorizes and instructs the
                    Company, as
                    its agent, to (i) create an invoice on behalf of Counselor for payment due based upon the hours recorded on the Transaction Log; and (ii) submit the invoice on behalf of Counselor
                    to
                    Counselor’s Host for payment. By recording time on a Transaction Log and allowing an invoice to be created based on that Transaction Log, Counselor represents and warrants that (y)
                    Counselor
                    has completed the applicable Counselor Services fully and satisfactorily; and (z) the hours Counselor reports are true, accurate, and complete.<br>
                    Transaction Log Review.&nbsp;Host must review and approve or dispute the Transaction Log within seven (7) days following submission of the Transaction Log. Payments will be held in
                    escrow
                    during the Dispute Period (defined below), providing 4 additional days to review and dispute work before funds are released. During the Dispute Period, Host may initiate a Dispute
                    as to some
                    or all of the time recorded on the Transaction Log. After the seven (7) day period following submission of the Transaction Log, Host will be deemed to have approved all undisputed
                    time, and
                    the Company, will release escrow funds as described in this Agreement.<br>
                    MAKING OR RECEIVING A BONUS OR EXPENSE PAYMENT.&nbsp;Host may also pay Counselor a bonus, tip, expense, or other miscellaneous payment, at Host’s discretion, using the Platform. To
                    pay a bonus
                    to a Counselor, Host must follow the instructions and links on the Platform and provide the information requested. If Host clicks to pay a bonus to Counselor the Company will
                    release escrow
                    funds as described in this Agreement.<br>
                    RELEASE AND DELIVERY OF AMOUNTS IN ESCROW.&nbsp;In addition, the Company is authorized to and will release applicable portions of the Host Escrow Account (each portion,
                    a&nbsp;“Release”) to
                    the Counselor Escrow Account, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. The amount of
                    the Release
                    will be delivered to the Counselor Escrow Account, in accordance with Counselor’s and Host’s instructions, as applicable, these Escrow Instructions, and the other agreements.<br>
                    RELEASE CONDITIONS.&nbsp;As used in these Escrow Instructions,&nbsp;“Release Condition”&nbsp;means any of the following:<br>
                    Host and Counselor have submitted joint written instructions for a Release.<br>
                    Host has approved all or a portion of the Counselor’s Transaction Log. This Release Condition will apply to and only for time recorded by the Counselor that Host has approved.<br>
                    Host has not disputed time recorded on Counselor’s Transaction Log during the Dispute Period pursuant to this Agreement. This Release Condition will apply to and only for time
                    recorded by the
                    Counselor that was not disputed by the Host.<br>
                    The Company reviews Host’s dispute of time recorded on Counselor’s Transaction Log for an Engagement with Work Diaries pursuant to this Agreement and determines that the time is
                    related to the
                    Engagement requirements or Host’s instructions documented in the Work Diaries.<br>
                    Host initiates a Dispute with respect to Counselor’s Transaction Log for an Engagement without Work Diaries pursuant to this Agreement and Host and Counselor resolve the dispute
                    without the
                    assistance of the Company.<br>
                    Issuance of the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which appeal is not taken.<br>
                    The Company believe, in the Company’s discretion, that Host or Counselor has committed or is attempting to commit fraud, illicit acts, or has violated the Company Terms of Use, in
                    which case
                    the Company take such actions as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law.<br>
                    PAYMENT PROTECTION FOR COUNSELORS.&nbsp;In the rare event that a Counselor’s Host does not make payment for legitimate services performed by a Counselor, the Company will provide
                    limited
                    payment protection to the Counselor as detailed below and in the User Agreement (“Payment Protection”) as a membership benefit to foster fairness, reward loyalty, and encourage the
                    Counselor
                    to continue to use the Platform Services for their business needs. Payment Protection will be offered only if all of the following criteria are met:<br>
                    Both Host and Counselor must have not disputed that which has been reported about the counseling session, its duration, or the amount posted on the Transaction Log.<br>
                    Host must have an Account in good standing, a valid and authenticated default Payment Method, and Host must agree to automatically pay for hours billed by Counselor through Work
                    Diaries.<br>
                    Counselor’s Account must be in good standing.<br>
                    The Company believe, in the Company’s sole discretion, that fraud, illicit acts, or a violation of the Company’s Agreement has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in
                    which case
                    Host and Counselor irrevocably authorize and instruct the Company to take such actions as the Company deem appropriate in the Company’s sole discretion and in accordance with
                    applicable law,
                    in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including to return the proceeds of such acts to their source of payment.</p>
                <p>The Company will investigate and determine in its sole discretion whether the above terms and conditions are met.</p>
                <p>Payment Protection does not apply to: (1) hours not authorized by Host in the Work Diaries; (2) bonus payments; (3) refunds; (4) manual time; (5) time added after Host has Disputed
                    a billing
                    and before the resolution of that incident; (6) Fixed-Price Contracts; and (7) Engagements prohibited by the Agreement. The maximum rate per hour protected by the Company to
                    Counselor under
                    the Payment Protection for Counselors is the lesser of: (i) the rate provided in the Hourly Contract terms; (ii) the usual hourly rate billed by Counselor on the Platform across
                    all Hosts; and
                    (iii) the going rate for the same skills on the Platform in Counselor’s area (such determination to be made in the Company’s sole discretion). The maximum amount of coverage under
                    the Payment
                    Protection for Counselors for the life of a relationship between the same Host and Counselor is $2,500, whichever is less.</p>
                <p>PAYMENT PROTECTION FOR HOST.&nbsp;The Company will adjust the invoice to Host for work that is not clearly related to either the agreed-upon counseling session and within the hours
                    authorized
                    for the week, subject to and conditioned on the following terms:<br>
                    Neither Host nor Counselor shall have disputed the Transaction Log.<br>
                    Host must have an Account in good standing and a valid and authenticated default Payment Method. Within the Transaction Log Review Period, Host must submit a Dispute specifically
                    identifying
                    the time billed that is not clearly related to the agreed-upon counseling session.</p>
                <p>The Company will investigate and determine in its sole discretion whether the above terms and conditions are met.</p>
                <p>DISPUTES BETWEEN COUNSELOR AND HOST.<br>
                    Disputes Initiated via the Platform.&nbsp;Host may dispute Counselor’s hours reported in the Transaction Log for the prior week (Sunday 12:00 a.m. midnight UTC to Sunday 11:59 p.m.
                    UTC) during
                    the five days following the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m. midnight UTC to Friday 11:59 p.m. UTC) (the&nbsp;“Dispute Period“). It is Host’s responsibility to
                    review the
                    Transaction Log of every Hourly-Rate Contract on a weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period. Once the Dispute Period expires, Host will be deemed to have
                    accepted the
                    Counselor Services and Counselor Fees and can no longer dispute them. Disputes can only address the hours billed, not the quality of the Counselor Services or the Work Product
                    provided under
                    Hourly-Rate Contracts. If Host disputes Counselor’s hours reported in the Transaction Log during the Dispute Period, Host and Counselor are encouraged to resolve the dispute
                    between
                    themselves. If Host and Counselor fail to come to a resolution, the Company will promptly investigate the Transaction Log and determine, in the Company’s sole discretion, whether
                    an adjustment
                    is appropriate. The Company’s determination of such dispute shall be final.If Host’s payment is unsuccessful, the Company will review the work to determine if it qualifies for
                    Payment
                    Protection. If the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that the work qualifies for Payment Protection, it will make payment to the Counselor.Host may choose to approve
                    Counselor’s work
                    prior to the end of the Dispute Period. If Host releases payment to Counselor prior to the end of the Dispute Period, Host certifies that it accepts the work and waives any further
                    right to
                    dispute.</p>
                <p>The User further acknowledge and agree that the Company is not and will not be a party to any such dispute. The Company may, at its sole discretion, withhold or delay payment in the
                    event of
                    dispute between a Host and a Counselor.</p>
                <p>Company Dispute Assistance.&nbsp;Non-binding dispute assistance (“Dispute Assistance”) is available within 30 days of the date of the last release of funds from Host to Counselor.
                    If Host or
                    Counselor contacts the Company via support ticket within 30 days of the date of the last payment from Host to Counselor and requests non-binding dispute assistance for any dispute
                    among
                    between (a&nbsp;“Dispute”), the Company will attempt to assist Host and Counselor by reviewing the Dispute and proposing a mutual, non-binding resolution. The Company will only
                    review the 30
                    days of work performed prior to the date a User requests Dispute Assistance.<br>
                    The Company Disputes team will notify Host and Counselor via ticket by providing a notice of dispute along with a request for information and supporting documentation (if any).<br>
                    If both Host and Counselor respond to the notice and request for information, then the Disputes team will review the documentation submitted and any information available on the
                    Platform that
                    pertains to the Dispute. After review, the Disputes team will propose a mutual, non-binding resolution based on the results of the review.<br>
                    The proposed resolution is non-binding; Host and Counselor can choose whether or not to agree to it. If Host and Counselor agree in writing to the proposed resolution, Host and
                    Counselor agree
                    that the Company is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release Escrow funds in accordance with the proposed resolution.<br>
                    If Host and/or Counselor disagree with the Company’s proposed, non-binding resolution then Host and/or Counselor must pursue the Dispute independently.<br>
                    The Company reserves the right to review the Counselor’s work for 30 days prior to the date of the request for Dispute Assistance for compliance with Payment Protection
                    requirements, and in
                    its sole discretion, to make adjustments to invoices, and to direct the Company to make appropriate releases to Host if it finds work that clearly does not relate Hourly Contract
                    requirements
                    or Host instructions or violations of the Agreement during its review of the work.<br>
                    NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR COUNSELOR SERVICES OR HOST PAYMENTS.&nbsp;The Company merely provides a platform for Internet payment services. The Company does not have any responsibility
                    or control
                    over the Counselor Services that Host purchases. Nothing in this Agreement deems or will be interpreted to deem the Company as Host’s or Counselor’s agent with respect to any
                    Counselor
                    Services, or expand or modify any warranty, liability or indemnity stated in the Agreement. For example, the Company does not guarantee the performance, functionality, quality, or
                    timeliness
                    of Counselor Services.</p>
